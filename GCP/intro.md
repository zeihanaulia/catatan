# GCP Console

## Projects in the GCP Console

A GCP Project is an organizing entity for your Google Cloud resources. It often times contains resources and servicesâ€”for example, it may hold a pool of virtual machines, a set of databases, and a network that connects them with one another. Projects also contain settings and permissions, which specify security rules and who has access to what resources.

It's not uncommon for large enterprises or experienced users of GCP to have dozens to thousands of GCP projects. Organizations use GCP in different ways, so projects are a good way to separate cloud-computing services (by team or product for example.)
